# RedditArchiver
 A simple python3 script to archive your favorite subreddits.

## How it works
RedditArchiver uses [pushshift.io's Reddit API](https://pushshift.io/api-parameters/) to archive subreddits. The maximum return of 1000 results per search is overcome by splitting the desired archive interval into smaller intervals which are likely to have less than 1000 posts.

## To-Do
